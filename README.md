Project Title: AeroSense: Arduino Based Air Quality Monitoring IOT Project

Description: The project involves developing an IoT-based air pollution monitoring system using an Arduino microcontroller and an MQ135 gas sensor. This system detects air quality by measuring pollutants and transmits the data wirelessly for real-time monitoring. 

Technologies Used: Flutter, Dart, IoT, ThingSpeak.

Features: 
  Real-time Air Quality Monitoring – Continuously measures air pollutants like CO₂, NH₃, and benzene.
  Cloud Connectivity – Sends sensor data to a cloud platform for remote access.
  Live Data Visualization – Displays real-time readings on an LCD screen and a cloud dashboard.
  Mobile App/ Web Dashboard – Allows users to monitor air quality using Flutter.
  Historical Data Logging – Stores previous air quality readings for analysis and trend monitoring.


Installation Instructions: Instructions on how to clone and run the app locally (for others or future you).

Setup: Instructions for setting up IoT devices and cloud services.
